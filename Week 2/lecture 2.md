### How can we Measure Quality and Adequacy?
- Mutation testing
- Code Coverage

### Fault Seeding
- Insert or seed representative

### Mutation Analysis and Testing
- Small local changes in the program
- Kill a mutant if this changed program fails some test or results in a different outcome from the original program
- Mutation analysis measures bug finding ability
- Mutation testing - create a test suite that kills a representative set of mutants


## For assignment 1
Some mutants that are not killed
Show logical equivalence to original program or create a test case that kills them
